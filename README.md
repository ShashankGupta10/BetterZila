# BetterZila Project

## Project Description
This project is a generative AI chatbot that specializes in extracting and comprehending information from PDF documents. It allows users to upload multiple PDF files, trains on the content of those documents, and enables them to ask questions or make queries related to the PDFs' content. The chatbot leverages Langchain, PyPDF2, and Streamlit to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Overview
- Training: The chatbot processes the PDFs using Langchain and PyPDF2 to extract textual data and generate a knowledge base.
- Chat Interface: Users can initiate conversations with the chatbot by asking questions or making inquiries within the scope of the PDF documents.
- Responses: The chatbot uses generative AI to provide meaningful responses based on the trained knowledge base.
- User-Friendly: The project is built with a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for easy interaction.
